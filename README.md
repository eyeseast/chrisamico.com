My site
=======

Not a blog. 

My personal site, going forward, should have:

- a professional bio
- contact info
- social links (twitter, linkdedin, FB, instagram)

I'd like to have a stream of links to stuff I'm reading. That's the biggest build thing.

And the site really, really needs a new theme, something from this decade.
