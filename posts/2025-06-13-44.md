[Dan Sinker is right](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/):

> In the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care.
>
> In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it.
>
> At a time where the government's uncaring boot is pressing down on all of our necks, the best way to fight back is to care. Care loudly. Tell others. Get going.
>
> As the culture of the Who Cares Era grinds towards the lowest common denominator, support those that are making real things. Listen to something with your full attention. Watch something with your phone in the other room. Read an actual paper magazine or a book.

It's my birthday today. I'm 44. I don't need anything and I have everything I could ever want for myself. What I want, from anyone reading this, is for you to find something you care about and give it everything you've got. That's it. That's a lot.

The world is on fire right now. It's easy to be overwhelmed and hard to know what to do. This is my advice and my ask: Find something you care about. Care as much as you can. Care until it hurts.
