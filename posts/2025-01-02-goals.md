title: A decade of goals
summary: How it started. How it's going.
---

Ten years ago, I wrote a list of things I wanted to get done in [2015](https://gist.github.com/eyeseast/94cb28629df105de9b1c). This is the whole thing:

> Finish the books I already started:
>
> - Moby Dick
> - For Whom The Bell Tolls
> - The Information
>
> Rebuild my blog and start blogging again.
>
> Build an iPhone app.
>
> Build a little robot or something else physical. [Try nodebots or something similar](http://nodebots.io/).

I added a few things later in the year, some tiny -- "Floss every day" -- and some pretty big -- "Buy a house (or condo, or whatever)." and "Have a baby."

I didn't mean for this to become a thing, but I did another one in 2016, and then it just sort of kept going. Now it's 2025, and I have a decade of these.

These aren't New Years resolutions, and some barely even count as goals, but a lot of this stuff gets done, and I don't think it would if I hadn't written it down.

Part of why I think they've worked for me is that it's become a mix of banal and ambitious -- rebuild my blog, get passports for the kids, read a certain number of books, take a family vacation. They've gotten more structured over the years and lots of things repeat.

I like using gists because I can write comments and leave notes on them. I revise them a lot and can go back if I need to. They're easy to share. Markdown is an easy format.

Looking back, there are goals I never hit. I've still never competed in jiujitsu, and I haven't finished Moby Dick or For Whom the Bell Tolls. Maybe those will happen this year.

One goal I added this year is to publish one piece of writing every week. I'm doing that now. See how well this works?
