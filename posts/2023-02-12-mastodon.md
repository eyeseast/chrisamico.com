title: Automatically posting shared links to Mastodon with Toot
---

I jumped from Twitter to [Mastodon](https://journa.host/@chrisamico) in November, shortly after Elon Musk took over and fired half the company's workforce. I've spent less and less time on Twitter in the last few years, but it was still a good place to watch for interesting discussions and links, and to share my own work. I took the app off my phone and, for the most part, I don't miss it.

Years ago, I set up a feed that piped stories I liked on Instapaper to my Twitter account. I honestly can't remember how I did that, and I'm not sure how to turn it off. Twitter's [new API pricing](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/twitter-says-the-basic-tier-of-its-api-will-cost-100-per-month/) will probably take care of that for me.

I finally got something similar -- better, even -- set up on Mastodon last night. It's part of this codebase, which means I can tweak it or turn it off or turn it up whenever I want. I'm using [toot](https://github.com/ihabunek/toot/), a Python client for Mastodon, on [Simon Willison's recommendation](https://til.simonwillison.net/mastodon/mastodon-bots-github-actions). It's a great library, though it seems mostly intended as a <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> tool.

I decided to use it directly from Python, because I wanted to record which links I've already posted. That part of `toot` isn't documented, but the code is easy enough to read. We'll see if this comes back to bite me. The whole script is [here](https://github.com/eyeseast/chrisamico.com/blob/main/links/mastodon.py).

The relevant part of the code, which posts to Mastodon and updates a SQLite table, is this function:

```python
def post_link(link):
    "post the update and record that I did it"
    updates = get_updated_table()
    app = load_app(HOST)
    user = load_user(f"{USER}@{HOST}")
    text = link_text(link)

    update = {"link_id": link["id"]}
    try:
        result = post_status(app, user, text)
        update.update(
            {
                "posted": result["created_at"],
                "status": UpdateStatus.success,
                "post_url": result["url"],
            }
        )
    except Exception as e:
        update.update({"status": UpdateStatus.failed, "error": str(e)})

    updates.insert(update)
```

It's ultimately a lot more code than Simon is [using](https://github.com/simonw/covidsewage-bot/blob/main/.github/workflows/toot.yml) to update his [COVID sewage bot](https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@covidsewage), but I think I have a better understanding of what's possible with the [Mastodon API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/) now. It definitely feels like something from the early days of Twitter, when people were inventing new ways to use a new platform, and it was fun.

I might build a bot or two.
