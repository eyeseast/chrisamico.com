[Spoiler warning: Some plot assumptions and an important character’s story 
are discussed in detail]  

In a story where engineers are more central than Jedi or Sith, Rogue One 
breaks new ground for the franchise both in its characters but also in the 
ethical territory it covers.  Not to diminish the character arcs of Jyn 
Erso and Cassian Andor, but the core ethical arc of the film is one man’s 
decision to engineer the Death Star in such a way as to prevent its use for 
galactic domination. One could fairly retitle the movie to ‘Rogue One: an 
Engineering Ethics Story.’

Our scifipolicy.com review essay will address Rogue One as the engineering 
ethics case study it is. Properly understanding the ethical power of the 
engineers in Rogue One enriches our understanding of good and evil in the 
Star Wars universe and furthers our understanding of what engineering 
ethically truly means.   

Only part of the story: blowing the whistle on the Death Star

The movie begins with the Death Star program director, Orson Krennic (Ben 
Mendelsohn) finding and returning his escaped top scientist, Galen Erso 
(Mads Mikkelsen). Despite all the resources of the Empire and its access to 
the dark side, the Death Star takes 15 more years to build, requiring 
incredible effort and the capabilities of a top designer and scientist of 
Galen’s caliber. The challenge of engineering was apparent to all, as Grand 
Moff Tarkin notes years of challenges and delays.  It is important to note 
that while the movie calls Galen a scientist, he was leading a design 
effort and a team of engineers. To us, he clearly is an engineer[1].

The film also makes its engineering ethics explicit. Before the opening 
scene, Galen Erso had escaped the Death Star project because of his moral 
objections, likely against the Empire as well as the concept of making such 
a terrifying weapon at all. After Krennic captures him, Galen later tells 
his daughter Jyn that he had a choice: he could have continued abstaining, 
and let someone else build the Death Star, or he could dive deep into the 
project, become indispensable to it, and find a way to stop it. He chooses 
to dive deep, and succeeds in building a subtle flaw in the Death Star 
design. Then 15 years later, he sends a messenger to the Rebellion 
informing them of the weapon’s existence, power and most importantly, its 
fatal flaw.

Galen’s reflection on engineering could have come straight out of real-life 
engineering discussions of the 1970s. As the historian Matthew Wisnioski 
captures in his book “Engineers for Change”, many engineers were criticized 
during the Vietnam War for their role in developing major weapons systems. 
In the real world, Galen could have become a conscientious objector and 
left the project, but oftentimes engineers can choose to stay engaged and 
try to influence the project. In our world, some engineers did change 
fields and while some engineering societies sponsored large public debates 
about the role of technology in society. Engineering schools added ethics 
to their curriculum, but Wisnioski suggests that the changes were 
ultimately too narrow.

Unfortunately, much of engineering ethics education has focused excessively 
on whistleblowing, and perhaps a limited view of Galen Erso’s actions would 
call what he did “whistle blowing,” as he alerted the rebels to the looming 
threat. We tend to agree with the engineer philosopher Samuel Florman who 
once wrote that “Whistle-blowing - to use a word that appears early and 
often in many discussions of engineering ethics - is a rare and extreme 
circumstance, worthy of consideration, to be sure, but not deserving of the 
central role it has been given in studies of the field.” What Galen Erso 
does is not simply watch a system be built and then whistleblow; he 
actively shaped the design from its earliest stages considering its 
ultimate societal impacts.  These early design decisions are proactive 
rather than reactive, which is part of the broader engineering ethics 
lesson of Rogue One.

Shaping designs in pursuit of a more just world

Galen Erso, as more than a conscientious whistleblower, highlights what a 
broader approach to engineering ethics can look like. Critically, Galen 
modified the Death Star design creating a critical flaw that could be used 
to destroy the Death Star. This weakness, a path for a missile charge to 
travel from the Death Star surface through an exhaust port to hit the 
center reactor, was then exploited by the Rebels and, in particularly, Luke 
Skywalker in Episode IV.  Erso demonstrates that if one is imaginative 
enough, there can be ways to change or modify a design so that it has a 
different impact on society, so that people can interact with the design in 
a positive way, or so that it can best contribute to a more just world.

While Galen’s change to the Death Star is an extreme case, akin to 
modifying a nuclear weapon design, engineers make many decisions that 
affect our everyday lives. Engineering and technology can critically define 
how people live and who has power. Philosopher of technology Langdon 
Winner’s article “Do Artifacts Have Politics?” argues that technology 
changes the world around them, creating policies and politics that result 
from the inherent (at times destructive) characteristics of the technology. 
Yet, it is not only the technology of advanced weapons that can shape our 
world. Social media and increased computer devices are affecting how humans 
think and how we act in a democratic society. An engineer must consider not 
only the function of a new system, but how it will be used and the possible 
unintended consequences, just as Galen Orso did when designing the Death 
Star.  

A complementary point to Winner is to think through how we have to labor to 
maintain existing systems. Historians Andy Russell and Lee Vinsel have 
started a social movement called The Maintainers, which tries to call 
attention to the neglected role of maintenance in society. While the Star 
Wars universe has a lot of ships and cities that look like they’re in a 
state of dystopic disrepair, there are also many who scavenge (such as Rey) 
and make the most out of existing systems.. A robust discussion of 
engineering ethics should consider how we treat the people and 
technological systems that maintain the broader society.

The Force is not enough?

The above issues are all substantial parts of engineering ethics, but there 
is one more highly speculative thought about engineering ethics in Star 
Wars that I want to explore. Rogue One surprised me in how much it 
highlighted how the dark side seems to rely on technology. In my reading of 
the original films, it always seemed to me that the Force was the most 
powerful source of change in the Galaxy, and that the Empire relied on 
technology only incidentally. As Vader said in Episode IV, the Death Star’s 
power is “insignificant next to the power of the Force.” The ultimate 
threat was the Emperor, and the two Death Stars and the Star Killer were 
secondary, almost easily summoned into being just in time for the next 
movie plot.

In contrast to that, Rogue One shows that the engineering development of 
the Death Star took decades to complete and was a much more complex and 
vexing development than we knew. While its plans were briefly shown in the 
prequels, the amount of work needed to make the Death Star a real 
engineering artifact required the focused attention over decades of 
Krennic, Tarkin and Vader. In this film, the Emperor’s long term survival 
and goals for the dark side rely on the challenging, detailed, and 
sometimes banal work of engineering and technology development. Despite the 
Emperor and Darth Vader’s great power in the force, they needed technical 
superiority to establish permanent galactic control [2].  

One way of describing this is to say that the dark side is seeking a 
technological fix [3]. A technological fix, as described by Daniel Sarewitz 
& Richard Nelson, is a technological solution found to address a complex, 
social problem.  On paper, a technological fix sounds great, due to its 
assumed replicability and reliability. However, problems in the real world 
can simply be too complex, defying any easy technological solution.  We 
never really know how effective the Empire’s technological fixes are, 
though, as the Rebels continue to destroy these mega-weapons before they 
are widely used.

But, if the Death Stars are a technological ‘fix’, then what is the problem 
that it’s trying to solve? Clearly they want to eliminate continued 
resistance to the Empire, as well as the possibility of battle with future 
Jedi or other light Side users. All technological factors being equal, 
perhaps the battle between the light and dark side will always come to a 
partial détente, as Yoda’s battle with Palpatine showed. Without a 
technological edge, there are individual victories that change the tide, 
but never fully wins the war.   The Death Star is the engineering artifact 
intended by the Emperor to tip the balance between the light and the dark. 
 

Interestingly, the dark side users abide by the ‘Rule of Two’, where there 
is only supposed to be a Sith master and a Sith apprentice, of which the 
latter is expected to take over from the master. This Rule of Two exists 
because multiple dark side users cannot be trusted: each will betray the 
others until they are in succession to eventually lead. Given the Rule of 
Two, there can never be an army of multiple Sith that fight, which means 
they need accessories to help promote their goals. Perhaps in this way, the 
real problem that the the Death Star hopes to fix is one of trust: it lets 
the Sith maintain power over others without needing to involve and 
ultimately trust another Sith.

As mentioned, this discussion also changes the interpretation of Luke 
Skywalker’s victory against the Death Star in Episode IV. It’s not simply a 
case of using the Force to beat a technologically superior foe.  While the 
light side of the Force (and an assist from Han Solo) was needed, so too 
was the ethical engineer who built in a design flaw into the Death Star. 
The entire fight scene can now be scene as a battle of light and dark with 
engineers shaping the terms of engagement.  

Conclusion:

Rogue One’s core story arc is about an engineer influencing a technological 
system that will transform the political order of the galaxy. Ultimately, 
Galen Erso engineers the system from the bottom up to have a critical flaw 
to ensure that this weapon of destruction could also, itself, be destroyed. 
 This character reminds us all that engineers can and must insert ethics 
into the heart of their work.  Galen Erso’s ethical objections amount not 
just to whistle-blowing, which is a standard, but limited part of 
engineering ethics. The movie demonstrates the broad range of engineering 
ethics which combines whistle-blowing, ethical design, and a fundamental 
consideration of the role of engineering in society.

When considering ethical engineering in Star Wars, a new range of questions 
emerge which, as #scifipolicy aficionados, we look forward to continuing to 
debate.  Was Luke Skywalker’s initial success only possible due to an 
ethical engineer? What is the balance of moral responsibility between the 
engineers and the force users? Does the final outcome of the battle between 
the light and dark sides depend upon engineering?  This is one role for 
science fiction in policy: to inspire questions, and perhaps provide some 
answers, that further illuminate the technological challenges we face in 
society right now. Reflecting on the ethical engineering in Star Wars can 
serve as amusing but fruitful practice for ethical engineering in the real 
world.

Footnotes:

[1] This is part of Hollywood’s habit of labeling as ‘science’ the most 
exciting parts of engineering. As Mark Watney said in The Martian while 
talking about many repair activities that were clearly engineering in 
nature: “I’m gonna have to science the shit out of this!” Do
such fictional representations affect the career choices of students, when 
all the cool aspects of engineering are made to seem like science 
activities? For more details on how engineering is different from science, 
see Henry Petroski’s The Essential Engineer. 
Also, a more substantive spoiler that provides a hint into what engineering 
is in Star Wars: to punish Galen for being a whistleblowing traitor, 
Krennic kills seemingly all of the six or so engineers who worked for 
Galen. Apparently the engineers are all disposable whereas the ‘scientist’ 
in charge is not! That the engineers were both few in number and all very 
old, white men seems deliberate.

[2] (12/21/16 Edit: this footnote was accidentally left out, thanks to RT 
for noting error in comments.) The Jedi and the Rebellion’s use of 
technology is different from the Sith’s. They use technology, having their 
own fighter and cruisers that can fight with Star Destroyers, but they 
never attempt to make a singular weapon. In the prequels, there are also 
many different Jedi, as they don’t need to constrain their number due to a 
lack of trust. There are hints of a sort of craft knowledge amongst the 
rebellion: Han Solo’s relationship with the Millenium Falcon is one of 
craft and informal learning – one might suspect he’d enjoy the book Zen and 
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance?  

[3] The clone wars are an interesting contrast here: did the creation of 
the clone army (and eventual stormtroopers) reflect a type of technological 
fix as well? In some ways, surely yes, but it’s of a very different nature 
than the Death Star. That was an example of a very distributed military, 
which could exert a person-to-person style of military control across the 
galaxy. The use of cloning technology is not necessary, and perhaps Episode 
VII’s use of non-clone but brainwashed stormtroopers is a return to that. 
The Death Star, in contrast, was a very singular and monolithic device that 
could destroy planets. Why did the Emperor decide to build the Death Star 
instead of building endless numbers of clones such that he would simply

<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--figure"" id=""d655"">Once while quarreling with a developer over CMS priorities I was told “hey, do I come to your team and tell you how to write stories.” And my immediate response was “yes, that’s exactly why we are discussing the CMS features.”</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"" id=""3a72""><span class=""markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other"">Technical features of a CMS dictate editorial. It’s as simple as that.</span></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"" id=""ede4"">Almost everyone intuitively understands this when they think about the CMS’ they engage with on the daily. We don’t classify Facebook’s compose box as a CMS, but that’s what it is. It’s an “open” CMS where anyone can get functionality by signing up.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"" id=""ea21"">Most newsrooms have a “closed” CMS and only employees have access. But let’s focus on the open CMS’s for now, since they are a common technological touchstone.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"" id=""0d6c"">The difference between Twitter and Instagram is ALL in the CMS. One starts with text, limits you to 140 characters and over time has allowed you to include multimedia. The other starts with a picture and you can add text only as a comment, but you have unlimited characters in those comments.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"" id=""f670"">This is why we recognize an Instagram post for what it is and a Tweet for what it is. Take the design away and I suspect people would still be able to recognize which platform a piece of content was published with — because it fits the CMS better. That is called “<a href=""https://medium.com/thoughts-on-media/what-is-platform-intelligence-embrace-the-constraints-ec5066c9eb00#.e25hufdyi"">Platform Intelligence</a>.”</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed"" id=""94c5""><span class=""markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">Technology and editorial are two sides of the same coin.</strong></span><span class=""markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other""> If you want to do something unique from an editorial front, you may have to create a custom CMS.</span></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"" id=""2478"">When Circa wanted to “atomize the news” that meant creating a CMS where “the article” was not the base of production.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"" id=""ee66"">While I’ve never seen “Chorus” the CMS of Vox, I’m confident the “Stacks” feature that was heralded when Vox launched was a core feature of the CMS.</p>

<div class=""document"">
<p>Python 3.6 was released in the tail end of 2016. Read on for a few highlights from this release.
New module: secrets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python 3.6 introduces a new module in the standard library called <tt class=""docutils literal"">secrets</tt>. While the <tt class=""docutils literal"">random</tt> module has long existed to provide us with pseudo-random numbers suitable for applications like modeling and simulation, these were not ""cryptographically random"" and not suitable for use in cryptography. <tt class=""docutils literal"">secrets</tt> fills this gap, providing a cryptographically strong method to, for instance, create a new, random password or a secure token.</p>
<div class=""section"" id=""new-method-for-string-interpolation"">
<h1>New method for string interpolation</h1>
<p>Python previously had several methods for string interpolation, but the most commonly used was <tt class=""docutils literal"">str.format()</tt>. Let’s look at how this used to be done. Assuming 2 existing variables, <tt class=""docutils literal"">name</tt> and <tt class=""docutils literal"">cookies_eaten, str.format()</tt> could look like this:</p>
<pre class=""literal-block"">""{0} ate {1} cookies"".format(name, cookies_eaten)
</pre>
<p>Or this:</p>
<pre class=""literal-block"">""{name} ate {cookies_eaten} cookies"".format(name=name, cookies_eaten=cookies_eaten)
</pre>
<p>Now, with the new f-strings, the variable names can be placed right into the string without the extra length of the format parameters:</p>
<pre class=""literal-block"">f""{name} ate {cookies_eaten} cookies""
</pre>
<p>This provides a much more pythonic way of formatting strings, making the resulting code both simpler and more readable.</p>
</div>
<div class=""section"" id=""underscores-in-numerals"">
<h1>Underscores in numerals</h1>
<p>While it doesn’t come up often, it has long been a pain point that long numbers could be difficult to read in the code, allowing bugs to creep in. For instance, suppose I need to multiply an input by 1 billion before I process the value. I might say:</p>
<pre class=""literal-block"">bill_val = input_val * 1000000000
</pre>
<p>Can you tell at a glance if that number has the right number of zeroes? I can’t. Python 3.6 allows us to make this clearer:</p>
<pre class=""literal-block"">bill_val = input_val * 1_000_000_000
</pre>
<p>It’s a small thing, but anything that reduces the chance I’ll introduce a new bug is great in my book!</p>
</div>
<div class=""section"" id=""variable-type-annotations"">
<h1>Variable type annotations</h1>
<p>One key characteristic of Python has always been its flexible variable typing, but that isn’t always a good thing. Sometimes, it can help you catch mistakes earlier if you know what type you are expecting to be passed as parameters, or returned as the results of a function. There have previously been ways to annotate types within comments, but the 3.6 release of Python is the first to bring these annotations into official Python syntax. This is a completely optional aspect of the language, since the annotations have no effect at runtime, but this feature makes it easier to inspect your code for variable type inconsistencies before finalizing it.</p>
</div>
<div class=""section"" id=""and-much-more"">
<h1>And much more…</h1>
<p>In addition to the changes mentioned above, there have been improvements made to several modules in the standard library, as well as to the CPython implementation. To read about all of the updates this new release includes, take a look at the <a class=""reference external"" href=""https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html"">official notes</a>.</p>

<p>It seems each week when I&rsquo;m reviewing data with someone a feature comes up that they had no idea existed within Postgres. In an effort to continue documenting many of the features and functionality that are useful, here&rsquo;s a list of just a few that you may find handy the next time you&rsquo;re working with your data.</p>

<h3>Psql, and \e</h3>

<p>This one I&rsquo;ve <a href=""http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/02/13/How-I-Work-With-Postgres/"">covered before</a>, but it&rsquo;s worth restating. Psql is a great editor that already comes with Postgres. If you&rsquo;re comfortable on the CLI you should consider giving it a try. You can even setup you&rsquo;re own <code>.psqlrc</code> for it so that it&rsquo;s well customized to your liking. In particular turning <code>\timing</code> on is especially useful. But even with all sorts of customization if you&rsquo;re not aware that you can use your preferred editor by using <code>\e</code> then you&rsquo;re missing out. This will allow you to open up the last run query, edit it, save–and then it&rsquo;ll run for you. Vim, Emacs, even Sublime text works just take your pick by setting your <code>$EDITOR</code> variable.</p>




<h3>Watch</h3>

<p>Ever sit at a terminal running a query over and over to see if something on your system changed? If you&rsquo;re debugging something whether locally or even live in production, watching data change can be key to figuring out. Instead of re-running your query you could simply use the <code>\watch</code> command in Postgres, this will re-run your query automatically every few seconds.</p>

<h3>JSONB pretty print</h3>

<p>I love <a href=""https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/07/14/choosing-nosql-hstore-json-jsonb/"">JSONB</a> as a datatype. Yes, in cases it won&rsquo;t be the <a href=""http://blog.heapanalytics.com/when-to-avoid-jsonb-in-a-postgresql-schema/"">optimal</a> for performance (though at times it can be perfectly fine). If I&rsquo;m hitting some API that returns a ton of data, I&rsquo;m usually not using all of it right away. But, you never know when you&rsquo;ll want to use the rest of it. I use <a href=""https://www.clearbit.com"">Clearbit</a> this way today, and for safety sake I save all the JSON result instead of de-normalizing it. Unfortunately, when you query this in Postgres you get one giant compressed text of JSON. Yes, you could pipe out to something like jq, or you could simply use Postgres built in function to make it legible:</p>

<h3>Importing my data into Google</h3>

<p>This one isn&rsquo;t Postgres specific, but I use it on a weekly basis and it&rsquo;s key for us at <a href=""https://www.citusdata.com"">Citus</a>. If you use something like Heroku Postgres, dataclips is an extremely handy feature that lets you have a real-time view of a query and the results of it, including an anonymous URL you can it for it. At Citus much like we did at Heroku Postgres we have a dashboard in google sheets which pulls in this data in real-time. To do this simple select a cell then put in: <code>=importdata(""pathtoyourdataclip.csv"")</code>. Google will import any data using this as long as it&rsquo;s in CSV form. It&rsquo;s a great lightweight way to build out a dashboard for your business without rolling your own complicated dashboarding or building out a complex ETL pipeline.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m missing a ton of the smaller features that you use on a daily basis. Let me know <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens"">@craigkerstiens</a> the ones I forgot that you feel should be listed.</p>",Simple but handy Postgres features,http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2017/01/08/simple-but-handy-postgresql-features/,,0,http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2017/01/08/simple-but-handy-postgresql-features/,2017-01-15 16:54:00.459187,,,,,,,,,,,,,
