She classified photos as either from ‚Äúlocals‚Äù or ‚Äútourists‚Äù, based on how far their profile location was from the photo‚Äôs geotag. These maps revealed fascinating psychogeographic patterns of urban exploration and photographic worthiness.
Last summer, Dario Taraborelli suggested extending this to iNaturalist observations.
Remember the classic "Locals &amp; Tourists" dataviz project by @enf? Has anyone tried applying the same method (&lt;30 days posting photos from a given location: you're a "tourist"; &gt;=30 days: you're "local") to @Team_eBird / @inaturalist data to measure local community participation?</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 18:33:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Allergies hitting early?
