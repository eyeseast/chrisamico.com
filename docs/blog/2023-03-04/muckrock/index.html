	<h1>MuckRock</h1>

		<p><time>Mar 04, 2023</time></p>
	</div>
	<div class="content"><p>I am heading to <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/">MuckRock</a> to work on <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/home/">DocumentCloud</a>. My last day at Gannett was yesterday; I start the new job on Monday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan and a user of DocumentCloud since it launched: I got PBS NewsHour into the beta test. I wrote a WordPress plugin (in PHP) to make embedding it easier at NPR &ndash; now MuckRock maintains that plugin. I build the <a href="http://www.homicidewatch.org">Homicide Watch</a> court document library (in javascript) on DocumentCloud before DocumentCloud had a way to embed more than one document at a time. I wrote an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/documents/23594627-letter-to-sec-on-congressman-santos/">integration</a> for USA TODAY and other Gannett sites (in Go).</p>
<p>DocumentCloud has become critical infrastructure for journalism. The developers who&rsquo;ve worked on it are people whose code I&rsquo;ve long admired and learned from. Now I&rsquo;ll have a hand in maintaining it. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;m going to miss my friends and colleagues across Gannett. At five years, it&rsquo;s the longest I&rsquo;ve ever stayed in one job. I started when the company was first calling itself USA TODAY Network, and figuring out what it meant to be a real network. My favorite projects were those that took advantage of the network, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/2021/11/20/us-forest-service-water-management-limited-oversight-diversions/8446212002/">like this one</a>.</p>
<p>My team, the Storytelling Studio, worked in a space between the newsroom and product &ndash; faster and more experimental than our colleagues managing the CMS and other infrastructure, more focused on tools and reusability than our friends on the graphics desk. I liked to say that we didn&rsquo;t fight fires, we built fire engines. It&rsquo;s a fun and challenging space to work in, and I had the luck of finding one of the best teams I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>
<p>Much of what I said in my <a href="https://chrisamico.com/blog/2023-02-01/three-kinds-of-code/">Three Kinds of Code</a> talk at NICAR 2020 comes from what I learned in the first two years with the Storytelling Studio, and using those lessons to reflect on my previous jobs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say more about what I learned at Gannett in future posts, but for now, all I want to say is that I&rsquo;m grateful for everything I got to do there, and especially for everyone I got to work with.</p>
<p>Onward to MuckRock.</p></div>
