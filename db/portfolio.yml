      - title: What if you could hear climate change? Listen to music based on a century of rainfall data
        url: https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/11/30/music-rainfall-climate-change/6354880001/
        publication: USA TODAY
        date: Nov. 30, 2021
        description: Climate change is altering rainfall patterns in the United States. I conceived of this presentation using sound to tell the story. Three composers from Full Sail University created original pieces of music using rainfall data from the investigation. I worked with the musicians on the concept and built the audio-playing charts in the story. The charts use Svelte and D3.

      - title: Draining the Forests

        date: Nov. 20, 2021
        description: I built a series of narrative maps in this investigation to help explain how mismanagement of water rights contributes to worsening drought. I worked with editors to design each step in the narrative and built a workflow allowing continuous updates as the story came together. The maps use Mapbox and my own [Ulysses-JS](https://github.com/eyeseast/ulysses-js) framework.

        date: April 6, 2018
        description: This is the story of three children growing up in the Marshall Islands, knowing they might be among the last to do so. I developed the overall technical architecture for the project using Svelte, ArchieML and Tarbell. I built an editing workflow (using ArchieML in a GoogleDoc) to manage assets throughout the project and taught reporters to use it. I built about half the interactive slides.

      - title: Poisoned Cities, Deadly Border

        publication: USA TODAY Network
        date: Dec. 5, 2018
        description: In designing this experience around a sprawling investigation of pollution on the US-Mexico border, we broke the story into fragments and let readers choose where to start based on how much time they had. I built the overall site architecture in Svelte and designed a mini-CMS using ArchieML.

      - title: Inheritance

  - title: Connecting users to investigations
    description: How do audiences connect with the data that reporters use? The projects below allow users to see the local impact of national stories, forging a deeper connection with our journalism. All use Svelte and Mapbox to create a fast interface that works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.
