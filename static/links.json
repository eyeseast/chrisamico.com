      "description": "In the battle between Light and Dark, engineers shape humanity\u2019s fate\r\n\r\n[Spoiler warning: Some plot assumptions and an important character\u2019s story \r\nare discussed in detail] \u00a0\r\n\r\nIn a story where engineers are more central than Jedi or Sith, Rogue One \r\nbreaks new ground for the franchise both in its characters but also in the \r\nethical territory it covers. \u00a0Not to diminish the character arcs of Jyn \r\nErso and Cassian Andor, but the core ethical arc of the film is one man\u2019s \r\ndecision to engineer the Death Star in such a way as to prevent its use for \r\ngalactic domination. One could fairly retitle the movie to \u2018Rogue One: an \r\nEngineering Ethics Story.\u2019\r\n\r\nOur scifipolicy.com review essay will address Rogue One as the engineering \r\nethics case study it is. Properly understanding the ethical power of the \r\nengineers in Rogue One enriches our understanding of good and evil in the \r\nStar Wars universe and furthers our understanding of what engineering \r\nethically truly means. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnly part of the story: blowing the whistle on the Death Star\r\n\r\nThe movie begins with the Death Star program director, Orson Krennic (Ben \r\nMendelsohn) finding and returning his escaped top scientist, Galen Erso \r\n(Mads Mikkelsen). Despite all the resources of the Empire and its access to \r\nthe dark side, the Death Star takes 15 more years to build, requiring \r\nincredible effort and the capabilities of a top designer and scientist of \r\nGalen\u2019s caliber. The challenge of engineering was apparent to all, as Grand \r\nMoff Tarkin notes years of challenges and delays. \u00a0It is important to note \r\nthat while the movie calls Galen a scientist, he was leading a design \r\neffort and a team of engineers. To us, he clearly is an engineer[1].\r\n\r\nThe film also makes its engineering ethics explicit. Before the opening \r\nscene, Galen Erso had escaped the Death Star project because of his moral \r\nobjections, likely against the Empire as well as the concept of making such \r\na terrifying weapon at all. After Krennic captures him, Galen later tells \r\nhis daughter Jyn that he had a choice: he could have continued abstaining, \r\nand let someone else build the Death Star, or he could dive deep into the \r\nproject, become indispensable to it, and find a way to stop it. He chooses \r\nto dive deep, and succeeds in building a subtle flaw in the Death Star \r\ndesign. Then 15 years later, he sends a messenger to the Rebellion \r\ninforming them of the weapon\u2019s existence, power and most importantly, its \r\nfatal flaw.\r\n\r\nGalen\u2019s reflection on engineering could have come straight out of real-life \r\nengineering discussions of the 1970s. As the historian Matthew Wisnioski \r\ncaptures in his book \u201cEngineers for Change\u201d, many engineers were criticized \r\nduring the Vietnam War for their role in developing major weapons systems. \r\nIn the real world, Galen could have become a conscientious objector and \r\nleft the project, but oftentimes engineers can choose to stay engaged and \r\ntry to influence the project. In our world, some engineers did change \r\nfields and while some engineering societies sponsored large public debates \r\nabout the role of technology in society. Engineering schools added ethics \r\nto their curriculum, but Wisnioski suggests that the changes were \r\nultimately too narrow.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, much of engineering ethics education has focused excessively \r\non whistleblowing, and perhaps a limited view of Galen Erso\u2019s actions would \r\ncall what he did \u201cwhistle blowing,\u201d as he alerted the rebels to the looming \r\nthreat. We tend to agree with the engineer philosopher Samuel Florman who \r\nonce wrote that \u201cWhistle-blowing - to use a word that appears early and \r\noften in many discussions of engineering ethics - is a rare and extreme \r\ncircumstance, worthy of consideration, to be sure, but not deserving of the \r\ncentral role it has been given in studies of the field.\u201d What Galen Erso \r\ndoes is not simply watch a system be built and then whistleblow; he \r\nactively shaped the design from its earliest stages considering its \r\nultimate societal impacts. \u00a0These early design decisions are proactive \r\nrather than reactive, which is part of the broader engineering ethics \r\nlesson of Rogue One.\r\n\r\nShaping designs in pursuit of a more just world\r\n\r\nGalen Erso, as more than a conscientious whistleblower, highlights what a \r\nbroader approach to engineering ethics can look like. Critically, Galen \r\nmodified the Death Star design creating a critical flaw that could be used \r\nto destroy the Death Star. This weakness, a path for a missile charge to \r\ntravel from the Death Star surface through an exhaust port to hit the \r\ncenter reactor, was then exploited by the Rebels and, in particularly, Luke \r\nSkywalker in Episode IV. \u00a0Erso demonstrates that if one is imaginative \r\nenough, there can be ways to change or modify a design so that it has a \r\ndifferent impact on society, so that people can interact with the design in \r\na positive way, or so that it can best contribute to a more just world.\r\n\r\nWhile Galen\u2019s change to the Death Star is an extreme case, akin to \r\nmodifying a nuclear weapon design, engineers make many decisions that \r\naffect our everyday lives. Engineering and technology can critically define \r\nhow people live and who has power. Philosopher of technology Langdon \r\nWinner\u2019s article \u201cDo Artifacts Have Politics?\u201d argues that technology \r\nchanges the world around them, creating policies and politics that result \r\nfrom the inherent (at times destructive) characteristics of the technology. \r\nYet, it is not only the technology of advanced weapons that can shape our \r\nworld. Social media and increased computer devices are affecting how humans \r\nthink and how we act in a democratic society. An engineer must consider not \r\nonly the function of a new system, but how it will be used and the possible \r\nunintended consequences, just as Galen Orso did when designing the Death \r\nStar. \u00a0\r\n\r\nA complementary point to Winner is to think through how we have to labor to \r\nmaintain existing systems. Historians Andy Russell and Lee Vinsel have \r\nstarted a social movement called The Maintainers, which tries to call \r\nattention to the neglected role of maintenance in society. While the Star \r\nWars universe has a lot of ships and cities that look like they\u2019re in a \r\nstate of dystopic disrepair, there are also many who scavenge (such as Rey) \r\nand make the most out of existing systems.. A robust discussion of \r\nengineering ethics should consider how we treat the people and \r\ntechnological systems that maintain the broader society.\r\n\r\nThe Force is not enough?\r\n\r\nThe above issues are all substantial parts of engineering ethics, but there \r\nis one more highly speculative thought about engineering ethics in Star \r\nWars that I want to explore. Rogue One surprised me in how much it \r\nhighlighted how the dark side seems to rely on technology. In my reading of \r\nthe original films, it always seemed to me that the Force was the most \r\npowerful source of change in the Galaxy, and that the Empire relied on \r\ntechnology only incidentally. As Vader said in Episode IV, the Death Star\u2019s \r\npower is \u201cinsignificant next to the power of the Force.\u201d The ultimate \r\nthreat was the Emperor, and the two Death Stars and the Star Killer were \r\nsecondary, almost easily summoned into being just in time for the next \r\nmovie plot.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to that, Rogue One shows that the engineering development of \r\nthe Death Star took decades to complete and was a much more complex and \r\nvexing development than we knew. While its plans were briefly shown in the \r\nprequels, the amount of work needed to make the Death Star a real \r\nengineering artifact required the focused attention over decades of \r\nKrennic, Tarkin and Vader. In this film, the Emperor\u2019s long term survival \r\nand goals for the dark side rely on the challenging, detailed, and \r\nsometimes banal work of engineering and technology development. Despite the \r\nEmperor and Darth Vader\u2019s great power in the force, they needed technical \r\nsuperiority to establish permanent galactic control [2]. \u00a0\r\n\r\nOne way of describing this is to say that the dark side is seeking a \r\ntechnological fix [3]. A technological fix, as described by Daniel Sarewitz \r\n& Richard Nelson, is a technological solution found to address a complex, \r\nsocial problem. \u00a0On paper, a technological fix sounds great, due to its \r\nassumed replicability and reliability. However, problems in the real world \r\ncan simply be too complex, defying any easy technological solution. \u00a0We \r\nnever really know how effective the Empire\u2019s technological fixes are, \r\nthough, as the Rebels continue to destroy these mega-weapons before they \r\nare widely used.\r\n\r\nBut, if the Death Stars are a technological \u2018fix\u2019, then what is the problem \r\nthat it\u2019s trying to solve? Clearly they want to eliminate continued \r\nresistance to the Empire, as well as the possibility of battle with future \r\nJedi or other light Side users. All technological factors being equal, \r\nperhaps the battle between the light and dark side will always come to a \r\npartial d\u00e9tente, as Yoda\u2019s battle with Palpatine showed. Without a \r\ntechnological edge, there are individual victories that change the tide, \r\nbut never fully wins the war. \u00a0\u00a0The Death Star is the engineering artifact \r\nintended by the Emperor to tip the balance between the light and the dark. \r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the dark side users abide by the \u2018Rule of Two\u2019, where there \r\nis only supposed to be a Sith master and a Sith apprentice, of which the \r\nlatter is expected to take over from the master. This Rule of Two exists \r\nbecause multiple dark side users cannot be trusted: each will betray the \r\nothers until they are in succession to eventually lead. Given the Rule of \r\nTwo, there can never be an army of multiple Sith that fight, which means \r\nthey need accessories to help promote their goals. Perhaps in this way, the \r\nreal problem that the the Death Star hopes to fix is one of trust: it lets \r\nthe Sith maintain power over others without needing to involve and \r\nultimately trust another Sith.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, this discussion also changes the interpretation of Luke \r\nSkywalker\u2019s victory against the Death Star in Episode IV. It\u2019s not simply a \r\ncase of using the Force to beat a technologically superior foe. \u00a0While the \r\nlight side of the Force (and an assist from Han Solo) was needed, so too \r\nwas the ethical engineer who built in a design flaw into the Death Star. \r\nThe entire fight scene can now be scene as a battle of light and dark with \r\nengineers shaping the terms of engagement. \u00a0\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nRogue One\u2019s core story arc is about an engineer influencing a technological \r\nsystem that will transform the political order of the galaxy. Ultimately, \r\nGalen Erso engineers the system from the bottom up to have a critical flaw \r\nto ensure that this weapon of destruction could also, itself, be destroyed. \r\n\u00a0This character reminds us all that engineers can and must insert ethics \r\ninto the heart of their work. \u00a0Galen Erso\u2019s ethical objections amount not \r\njust to whistle-blowing, which is a standard, but limited part of \r\nengineering ethics. The movie demonstrates the broad range of engineering \r\nethics which combines whistle-blowing, ethical design, and a fundamental \r\nconsideration of the role of engineering in society.\r\n\r\nWhen considering ethical engineering in Star Wars, a new range of questions \r\nemerge which, as #scifipolicy aficionados, we look forward to continuing to \r\ndebate. \u00a0Was Luke Skywalker\u2019s initial success only possible due to an \r\nethical engineer? What is the balance of moral responsibility between the \r\nengineers and the force users? Does the final outcome of the battle between \r\nthe light and dark sides depend upon engineering? \u00a0This is one role for \r\nscience fiction in policy: to inspire questions, and perhaps provide some \r\nanswers, that further illuminate the technological challenges we face in \r\nsociety right now. Reflecting on the ethical engineering in Star Wars can \r\nserve as amusing but fruitful practice for ethical engineering in the real \r\nworld.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nFor more like this, please follow the blog or join us on twitter: \r\nhttps://twitter.com/scifipolicy\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] This is part of Hollywood\u2019s habit of labeling as \u2018science\u2019 the most \r\nexciting parts of engineering. As Mark Watney said in The Martian while \r\ntalking about many repair activities that were clearly engineering in \r\nnature: \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to science the shit out of this!\u201d Do\r\nsuch fictional representations affect the career choices of students, when \r\nall the cool aspects of engineering are made to seem like science \r\nactivities? For more details on how engineering is different from science, \r\nsee Henry Petroski\u2019s The Essential Engineer.\u00a0\r\nAlso, a more substantive spoiler that provides a hint into what engineering \r\nis in Star Wars: to punish Galen for being a whistleblowing traitor, \r\nKrennic kills seemingly all of the six or so engineers who worked for \r\nGalen. Apparently the engineers are all disposable whereas the \u2018scientist\u2019 \r\nin charge is not! That the engineers were both few in number and all very \r\nold, white men seems deliberate.\r\n\r\n[2] (12/21/16 Edit: this footnote was accidentally left out, thanks to RT \r\nfor noting error in comments.)\u00a0The Jedi and the Rebellion\u2019s use of \r\ntechnology is different from the Sith\u2019s. They use technology, having their \r\nown fighter and cruisers that can fight with Star Destroyers, but they \r\nnever attempt to make a singular weapon. In the prequels, there are also \r\nmany different Jedi, as they don\u2019t need to constrain their number due to a \r\nlack of trust. There are hints of a sort of craft knowledge amongst the \r\nrebellion: Han Solo\u2019s relationship with the Millenium Falcon is one of \r\ncraft and informal learning \u2013 one might suspect he\u2019d enjoy the book Zen and \r\nthe Art of Motorcycle Maintenance?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n[3] The clone wars are an interesting contrast here: did the creation of \r\nthe clone army (and eventual stormtroopers) reflect a type of technological \r\nfix as well? In some ways, surely yes, but it\u2019s of a very different nature \r\nthan the Death Star. That was an example of a very distributed military, \r\nwhich could exert a person-to-person style of military control across the \r\ngalaxy. The use of cloning technology is not necessary, and perhaps Episode \r\nVII\u2019s use of non-clone but brainwashed stormtroopers is a return to that. \r\nThe Death Star, in contrast, was a very singular and monolithic device that \r\ncould destroy planets. Why did the Emperor decide to build the Death Star \r\ninstead of building endless numbers of clones such that he would simply \r\noverrun all resistance?",

But one key to understanding why today's assassination is not like that other assassination 102 years ago is realizing that our collective understanding of what happened during the so-called \"July Crisis\" of 1914 is basically wrong.",
